# Atom: The Atomic Programming Development Environment.

Before you "begin": please review https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.32/index.html for incentive compatibility. - [my legal team]

Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and based on a lot of love for our team's favorite editors.  
We designed it to be deeply customizable and approachable using well polished default settings.
